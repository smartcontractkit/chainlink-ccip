# CRIB
“CRIB” stands for “Chainlink Running-in-a-Box”.  CRIB is tooling that enables CLL developers to quickly spin up ephemeral development and/or testing environments that closely mimic a product’s staging environment with all the required Chainlink dependencies.

This repository contains CRIB CLI configuration and tooling required to spin up CRIBs from CLI.
