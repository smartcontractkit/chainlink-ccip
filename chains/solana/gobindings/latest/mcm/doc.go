package mcm

// Documentation from the IDL:
// A multi-signature contract system that supports signing many transactions targeting
// multiple chains with a single set of signatures. This program manages multiple multisig
// configurations through Program Derived Accounts (PDAs), each identified by a unique
// multisig_id.
//
// Key Features:
// - Multiple Configurations: A single deployed program instance can manage
// multiple independent multisig configurations
// - Hierarchical Signature Groups: Supports complex approval structures with
// nested groups and customizable quorum requirements
// - Merkle Tree Operations: Batches signed operations in Merkle trees for
// efficient verification and execution
//
// Usage Flow:
// 1. Initialize multisig configuration with a unique ID
// 2. Set up signer hierarchy and group structure
// 3. Set a Merkle root with authenticated metadata and signatures
// 4. Execute operations by providing Merkle proofs
