package timelock

// Documentation from the IDL:
// The `timelock` program provides a mechanism to schedule, execute, and (if needed) cancel
// operations in a delayed fashion. It supports both standard operations (which enforce delays and dependencies)
// and bypass operations (for emergency cases).
//
// Operation management for timelock system, handling both standard (timelock-enforced)
// and bypass (emergency) operations.
//
// Standard Operation Flow:
// - initialize -> append(init_ix, append_ix_data) -> finalize -> schedule -> execute_batch
// - Enforces timelock delays and predecessor dependencies
//
// Bypass Operation Flow:
// - initialize -> append(init_ix, append_ix_data) -> finalize -> bypass_execute_batch
// - No required delay or additional checks, closes operation account after execution
//
// Implementation uses separate code paths and PDAs for each operation type
// to maintain clear security boundaries and audit trails, despite similar logic.
// All operations enforce state transitions, size limits, and role-based access.
