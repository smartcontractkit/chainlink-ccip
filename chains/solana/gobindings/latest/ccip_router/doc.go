package ccip_router

// Documentation from the IDL:
// The `ccip_router` module contains the implementation of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Router.
//
// This is the Collapsed Router Program for CCIP.
// As it's upgradable persisting the same program id, there is no need to have an indirection of a Proxy Program.
// This Router handles the OnRamp flow of the CCIP Messages.
//
// NOTE to devs: This file however should contain *no logic*, only the entrypoints to the different versioned modules,
// thus making it easier to ensure later on that logic can be changed during upgrades without affecting the interface.
