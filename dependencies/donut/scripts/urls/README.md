A simple script that generates URLs of following CRIB components:
- DON
- chains
- Job Distributor

It requires both command line flags and environment variables. The latter ones are the same as environment variables used by the `donut` component, so that we can reuse them.

URLs are both printed to the console and saved as JSON file.
