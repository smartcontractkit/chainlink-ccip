# scripts

This directory contains scripts that are used to automate various tasks. Any bash scripts that should be sourced from other bash scripts should be stored in the `./lib` directory.

## TODO

- [ ] Consolidate (and deduplicate) scripts from ccip/scripts/ and core/scripts/ into this directory.
