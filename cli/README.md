# Command line interface for CRIB

## Original motivation

Act as a replacement for cribbit.sh and other shell scripts called by devspace. See <https://smartcontract-it.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CRIB/pages/944603174/Replace+cribbit.sh+and+the+DevSpace+shell-script+hooks+with+an+application> for context.

## Vision

- Provide an interface for managing a CRIB's installation lifecycle.
- Designed to be used as a standalone CLI or from within devspace, as a dependency/plugin providing logic for hooks/validations.
